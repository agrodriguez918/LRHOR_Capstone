Florida Polytechnic's LRH OR Capstone Team Project

Lakeland Regional Health has asked us to create them a functioning dashboard that works in real-time within their Operating Rooms throughout the hospital. It must account real-time information including operation information and cleanup/transition. The aim is to have it a 30-minute turnaround time for 80%+ of their weekly cases. It must function properly with current implemented applications used. This Github repository contains our solution to this problem. The branch schema for the repository as well as their deliverables are included below.
